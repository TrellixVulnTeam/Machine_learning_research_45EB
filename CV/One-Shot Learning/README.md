# One-Shot Learning

This is an attempt to implement One-Shot Learning on Omniglot dataset (aka Transposed MNIST), using Siamese Network, which are two neural networks trained to diffrentiate between two image inputs.

### Prerequisites
1. Python - 3.5 +
2. Keras - 2.2.0 +
3. Tensorflow - 1.7 +


## Running the tests
To replicate the results, run python main.py on the terminal (Ubuntu, Mac OSX) or command window (Windows)
