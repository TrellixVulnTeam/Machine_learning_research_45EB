# Wasserstein InfoGAN
This Project aims at implemeting a hybrid GAN derived from InfoGAN which regualrizes on the mutual information between real and fake data along with usage of Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty which avoids mode collapse, a big problem with traditional GANs

## Dependencies
- Python 2.7 +
- Keras 2.1.0 +
- Tensorflow 1.5 +
- Cuda 9.0 +

## Execution
- type command python main.py on the terminal, additional datasets such as CiFAR-10, CiFAR-100, CUB to be used in the framework
